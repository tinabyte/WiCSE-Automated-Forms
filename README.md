## Other things to note
(These files are messy, sorry in advance ðŸ˜­)
How to use, download the files, and run it specfic to your needs. For example, if you want to make a room reservation. Download roomReservationForm.py and replace the str, email, and chromeDriver location and run the file. 

For the postRequest, you must input the AM and PM, and instagram caption manually... I couldn't get emojis to work ðŸ’”

The submit button is commented out, but if you feel confident enough that the code works to your intent, uncomment it out and it will auto submit. (room reservation)
